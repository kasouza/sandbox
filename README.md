# sandbox

Sandbox is a falling sand game/simulation written completely from scratch with C using OpenGL.

# Build
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. && cmake --build .
```
And then run with:
```
cd src    /
./sandbox or` sandbox.exe
```
Note: If you want to move the executable somewhere else make sure to also copy the `assets` and `shaders` folders.
